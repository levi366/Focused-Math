# Focused-Math
Proof of concept (Masters Studio)

This project was a proof of concept for my masters degree.  
The idea is to provide a student with math questions while the 
Neurosky Mindwave records and displays the students attention.

There is a server that displays what students are logged in and 
charts attention and answers (correct/wrong).  Tutors can then provide
assistance if a weak area is found.

The project is written in Java and (as stated) utilizes the Neurosky 
Mindwave.  I have included my exposition paper which includes
research and documentation

Future:

I would like to move the project away from flat files to a database.
Flat files were used to make data collection and analysis easier, but
quickly becomes unwieldy.

In addition, I would like to add security features with the implementation
of the database.  For our research the software was run over a network with
no internet access and closely monitored. I would like to move to a more
generalized use case.
